    title: 'Extreme Ownership',
    author: 'Jocko Willink',
    thumbnail: extremeOwnership,

The book demonstrates how these military leadership principles apply effectively in business and life.',
    notes: [
      { text: `As a former military person I often find that few books written my military leaders have strong application to Business leaders.  The work, afterall, is so very different;  so I can understand why some business leaders shy away from books written by military folks. 
But what sets this book apart is that its focus isn’t on the “work”, it’s on the “people”, specifically how to best lead people through performance issues.  It presents the simple but powerful concept of “extreme ownership”….When you or someone on your team makes a mistake, hiding it is a disaster.  Just “Owning it” (simply admitting it happened but given excuses) doesn’t provide much more value.  But EXTREME ownership…admitting it, discussing it, analyzing it, learning from it, and using those lessons learned to inform future decisions solves SO MANY problems.  It also creates a culture where failure isn’t shameful but a great feedback mechanism to the business.  It’s one of the best leadership books I’ve read on taking responsibility, improving yourself and your team. `, contributor: "Caitlin Schuman", imageUrl: caitlin },
